# SSE QMC Model Implementation in C++

This repository contains the implementation of the **Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method** for simulating quantum lattice models. This code was developed as part of the research presented in the paper:  
Note: This code is an extension to this paper.

The original code can be found from repository.
**[Title of Your Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14254)**.

## Features

- Efficient SSE QMC simulation of Bilayer Spin-1 J-Q models.
- Customizable lattice sizes, coupling parameters, and model configurations.
- Support for measuring observables like energy, magnetization, and correlation functions with high end analysis and bayesian statistics.

## Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

- **C++ compiler** supporting C++17 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- **CMake** for build automation (optional but recommended)
- [Optional] **Boost** or other libraries, if used in the code.

### **Installation**

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/sse-qmc.git
cd sse-qmc
